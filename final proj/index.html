	<h1>
		Note: Due to the size of the data collected for this project, as well as time constraints, only a few players and images will be displayed in this version of the website. I will eventually go back and insert all the other players in future editions of this site, but that won't be hosted here.
	</h1>
	<h3>
		Research for this website was conducted with the help of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/">Pro Football Reference</a>. It was pretty tedious combing through thousands of <a href="https://www.nfl.com/">NFL</a> players to collect the necessary data, but it was also kinda fun because it introduced me to some players that I would've likely never heard of before.

	Fun fact: the data initially focused on just players who played for <i>seven</i> or more teams, which would've significantly decreased the amount of players in my sample, but I ended up expanding it to a minimum of six somewhere down the line. I currently have no plans to expand the list to five due to how painstakingly tedious that would be.
