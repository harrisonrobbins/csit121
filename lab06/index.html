    <h2>How to Make a Cheeseburger</h2>
  <p>You'll need the following ingredients:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Cheese (your choice on which kind you use)</li>
  <li>Beef (at least 20% fat to ensure juiciness)</li>
  <li>Two slices of bread <b>or</b> one bun</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How to prepare a cheeseburger:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your grill or oven top. It's recommended that you heat your burger to 160-165Â°F.</li>
    <li>When the grill/oven is heated enough, place the beef patty onto the pan.</li>
    <li>After around seven minutes, flip the patty over. You may have to wait longer depending on the size of the patty.</li>
    <li>When the burger is close to ready, place a slice of cheese onto the patty.</li>
    <li>Once the patty is heated to preference on both sides, remove it from the pan and place it onto the bread.</li>
    <li>Turn off the grill/oven and set the pan aside to cool down.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>I can't really explain why I like burgers so much, I just do. It's probably something to do with the juicy taste that hits different compared to other food, but I couldn't tell you definitively.</p>
